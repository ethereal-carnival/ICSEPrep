1. Check if an input number is perfect. In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3 (excluding itself), and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number.

2. Check if an input number is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. madam or 11011.

3. Display all prime factors of a number. Eg: 150 = 2*3*5*5, so prime factors are 2, 3, 5 and 5. Total 4.

4. Write a menu-based program that asks user to choose from these options, and executes the chosen option:
 a. Check if an input character is upper case of lower case
 b. Check if an input character is a digit, a letter or a white space
 c. Convert an input character into uppercase
Program should ask user if they want to continue and exit only when users inputs "n" in response to the question.

5. Ask user to enter a list of 10 numbers and sort them in descending order

6. Ask user to enter a list of 5 numbers and show the sum

7. TBC - Constructors/Functions based
